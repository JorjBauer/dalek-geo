This is a remote built around a Zettaguard New Classic Pro Controller
Console Gampad/Joypad For Nintendo Wii WiiU Black(ZG-WC1). Whew,
that's a mouthful.

I got the most recent one from Amazon here, in 2017:

It's a knockoff. If you use an actual original Wii controller, the
protocol is slightly different. This is the third time I've done this,
with different models of knock-off Wii controllers, and all of them
have been identical (protocol-wise; the guts differ very slightly).

I've opened it up and embedded a Moteino with an RFM69; a SparkFun
PRT-14411 LiPo Charger/Booster 5v/1A; and a 350mAh 3.7v LiPo battery
(from Adafruit, p/n 2750). There's also a charging jack and a power
switch; and two embedded LEDs (one wired to the Moteino pin 6, and one
wired to the LED on the LiPo charger).
